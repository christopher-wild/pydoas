    1. Include "scans" (e.g. for MAX DOAS measurements)
        1. Defined by Start/Stop of individual FitResultFiles
    #. Convenience functionality for scans
        #. All scans in time interval
        #. All data with species X (e.g. SO2) larger / smaller than thresh 
        (e.g. 1E+18 cm-2)
    #. Plotting
        1. Diurnal profiles (e.g. BrO/SO2)
        #. Individual scans (data vs. Elevation / Azimuth /plume age)
            1. Plume cross section (scans perpendicular to plume propagation direction) 
            #. Plume evolution (scans along plume propagation direction)
